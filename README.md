Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final

Primary Tool: Power BI Desktop (for Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Visualization)

🧹 Data Preparation and Transformation
Data preparation was performed extensively within the Power BI Query Editor (Power Query) to ensure the visualizations are based on clean, accurate, and ready-to-model data.

Key Cleaning and Transformation Steps:
Data Type Validation: Ensured all numerical (Sales, Profit, Quantity) and temporal (Order Date, Ship Date) columns were correctly typed.

Handling Nulls/Errors: Addressed missing or erroneous values in relevant columns.

Feature Engineering (New Columns): Created several new calculated columns to enhance the analysis, including:

Profit Margin: Calculated as Profit / Sales to assess product-level profitability.

Year/Month/ Columns: Extracted from the Order Date for time-series analysis.

📊 Key Visualizations and Insights
The Power BI report dashboard provides an interactive platform to explore the data. Key areas of focus and visualizations include:

Geographic Analysis: A dropdown menu allowing for specific area analysis.

Product Performance: Bar charts comparing sales, profit, and quantity across categories and sub-categories to identify top performers and underperforming segments.
